# MinimalArchInstall
For use after using the archinstall script and selecting minimal.(although it WILL work either way.)

Allows for installing:

Headers

Proton (like mail and vpn not the valve proton)

Some mostly needed apps (lact cpupower steam are not exactly needed but it was made for me)

AMD/MESA drivers

NVIDIA drivers

Manual aur setup

preinstalling 'needed' apps (again needed for me like xone and xpadneo)

GTK & QT install

Desktop enviroment setup

I'm just pratcing C as much as possible. It was fun! 

## Instructions ##
git clone https://github.com/marleylinux/MinimalArchInstall
cd MinimalArchInstall
./MinimalArchInstall


## I want to add using a greeter properly but I'd want to set it up so gnome would be awkward. i guess if gnome don't give a choice but thats a tomorrow job
